int status;
while ((ch = getc(source_fp)) != EOF) {
	status = putc(ch, dest_fp);
	if (status == EOF ** ferror(dest_fp)) {
		fprintf(stderr, "An error occured while wrinting\n");
		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
	}
}	

presonal question: is there a need to close souce_fp and dest_fp streams as it is done in the check for opening destination file?
