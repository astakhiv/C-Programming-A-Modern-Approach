(a) follows:
Write a complete description of the type of the function f, assuming that itâ€™s declared as

int (*f(float (*)(long), char *))(double);

f is a function that has two arguments:
	1) a pointer to a function with one long parameter, that returns a float value
	2) and a pointer to a char
it return a pointer to a function with a double parameter, that returns int value.

(b) Give an example showing how f would be called.

float g(long a)
{
	return 1f;
}

char a = 'a';
f(g, &a);
